    "Elara": "A young woman in her early twenties with medium-length, wavy auburn hair tied back in a practical, slightly messy ponytail. She has bright, observant hazel eyes. Her build is lean and athletic. She wears sturdy, comfortable travel clothes: a forest green tunic with rolled-up sleeves, dark brown leggings, and well-worn, scuffed leather boots. A simple silver pendant on a thin cord hangs around her neck. Her expression shifts from hesitant to determined to confident throughout the panels.",
    "Master Kael": "A middle-aged man with a calm and serene demeanor. He has short, neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper hair and a matching, well-maintained beard. His deep blue eyes convey wisdom and patience. He wears simple, flowing earth-toned robes (muted gray-brown) with a subtle, circular embroidered pattern on the cuffs. He carries a smooth, polished wooden staff, unadorned, which he uses for support. His posture is always upright and composed."
